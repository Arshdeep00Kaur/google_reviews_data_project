Not only did they fail to rectify the issues, but they also refused to provide a refund for their subpar services. It's clear that customer satisfaction and integrity are not priorities for Net Solutions.

Save yourself the headache and avoid Net Solutions at all costs. Their inability to deliver on their promises and their unwillingness to take responsibility for their mistakes make them a poor choice for any project.

Instead of reaching out to me directly to address the issues raised in my review, they decided to post false claims, trying to shift the blame onto us, the customer. This is exactly what they do‚Äîavoid taking responsibility and instead place the blame on the client. They do not hold themselves accountable for their own failures.

If you have a project that requires experienced, senior-level resources, stay far away from this company.

They destroyed the activa valves simply because it was in a prohibited area. If parking Activa wasn't permitted, they ought to have told us, at the very least stopped us, or demanded that we pay a fine. However, what they did was such an obnoxious act. Who will take the responsibility? Taking such drastic action that could endanger anyone's safety without communication is completely unacceptable.

Please place at least a sign saying ""No Parking"" in areas where parking two wheeler vehicle is prohibited. Second, be sure of the presence of security personnel who can inform the person. I am aware that the time they wasted cant be compensated. But however Mr.JAGNATH whatever the name was instructed the guards to do such rubbish act should apologize and consider my feedback. thanks!",2 years ago,Netsmartz,Chandigarh
