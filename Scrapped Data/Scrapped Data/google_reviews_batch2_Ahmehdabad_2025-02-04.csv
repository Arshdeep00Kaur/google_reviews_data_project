Hey everyone,

Let me tell you about the time I threw £16,000 down the drain with a company called IndiaNIC, dreaming of a sleek e-commerce site for my business, SIRRI. What a journey it's been - and not the fun kind. Imagine trusting Bhavin Batt and Kiran Jadav, the big names at IndiaNIC, only to end up with a website that's as functional as a chocolate teapot.

Promised a smooth ride and a project wrapped up in 6-12 months, I ended up on a never-ending carousel ride for over two years. And the prize? A website so broken, it's practically a digital wasteland. Every penny of the £13,000 development cost and the extra £3,000 on AWS servers felt like money tossed into a black hole.

I've got a treasure trove of chat histories and recordings that paint the real picture of what went down. It's like a saga of broken promises and shrugged shoulders when I asked for a refund or even just a path forward. They claimed they delivered; I say they delivered a mess.

After a grueling three years and jumping ship to another platform, I finally got what I was promised by someone else. So, what's the moral of the story? Run. Run far away from IndiaNIC and don't look back.

If you're on the hunt for a tech partner, my advice is to do your homework. Don't get dazzled by smooth talkers or fancy portfolios. Demand the real deal - proof of their successes, straight talk from past clients, and clear accountability.

I'm laying it all out here - not just to vent, but to hopefully save some of you from making the same mistake. If you're curious or even a bit skeptical about my story, I'm here with receipts. Chat logs, recordings - you name it. I'm an open book if it means helping someone else avoid this tech partnership pitfall.",9 months ago,Ahmehdabad,IndiaNIC
