2. To go into higher designation through the support of Level up is horrible. We need to read a lot of things to move into higher designation.

The interviewer was asking meaning less questions on Supply Chain, Procurement etc. Why would you waste time asking some MBA/Academic questions to  mid senior level candidate ? I understand the basics are important but this was sheer waste of time. Is my experience important or some textbook knowledge?

I did a background on this organization. Most of the employees are from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia etc. They have a use and throw policy  - Once the project is over, you will be terminated.

After clearing the initial interview round, I was encouraged by their team to take an early release from my current job, with the assurance that my selection was nearly certain, pending a few additional rounds. Trusting their confidence in me, I took the early release.

Following two rounds with their senior team, I was scheduled for a client interview, during which I was rejected with the feedback that I lacked experience and knowledge. This was shocking, as the feedback was inconsistent with my previous interviews, and it contradicted the confidence they initially showed in me.

After losing my job and being left in a precarious situation, the HR team scheduled me for another project. Once again, I cleared their internal technical rounds, only to be rejected by the client with similar feedback. This has left me feeling frustrated and misled.

If I truly lacked the skills or experience, it begs the question: why was I pushed to leave my previous job and subjected to multiple rounds, only to be rejected at the final stage? The entire process felt unprofessional and left me jobless due to their mismanagement.

Advice : Please ensure a more transparent and considerate hiring process. Candidates' careers and livelihoods are at stake, and the decisions made by your hiring team have real consequences. If a candidate is not a fit, it should be identified early in the process, and not after they've taken life-altering steps based on your advice.",5 months ago,Hyderabad,ValueLabs
