Worst nightmare and anand mahindra doesnt even care beside tweeting in twitter‚Ä¶.I am writing this to let you know that I am filing an official complaint against the aasurant management that they are the worst management i have ever seen and they dont have courage to talk to me for anything. Ask anyone if they have talked to me before this decision. Now what they will do is take revenge and stop my relieving letter. If they have courage to talk to an employee i will come to office and see if they can talk how they harrasing the people there in the assurant. They have not given me exception on my behavior. Ask feedback about the management there from anyone working there. These guys should be terminated too. Mayank, gaurav, yatin , priya, amarjeet, pankaj no one came forward to talk to me. They all should be terminated. The manager should tell me about rhe smooth exit but they dont have courage to talk. Only thihg they say is talk to HR.  I will quote everything in social media too so that they get exposed. I cant use abusive words here. I will come to office and if they have courage come and talk to me and see how much empathy u have. They  dont know nothing. So much experience but dont know anything about work and ethics. I want compensation for this month too or I will file a court case agaisnt the management. I have all the proofs. All phone call records and mails and everything. I will drag each one of you. All i was searching was empathy and they have nothing. When I asked for leaves due to liver issue they didnt give it instead wasted my time and was that a big thing i was asking i have given the medical and all and they were like aliens that they dont know how to handle it. Even after their medical team approved it yatin said that i cant give leaves. Who is he to decide? All i was asking for day shift for 2 weeks only and their legs shaken. And they talk about my behavior. I am writing this each and every person should read it whole otherwise u will miss the purpose. After that when i start joining all i was asking for some refresher and wht they do is given 1 week training and says there is a certification. The certification which they had taken earlier was a joke.. every person cheated and passed. So in my case they take certification like I am giving upsc exam. I cleared first one technically because pankaj didnt checked properly the exam. And when I raised it, and find some answers are correct he said ok i am allowing u to get into production. Then suddenly after 2 days mayank says give test again. There is no cooperation between them. In second and thirdd test amarjeet make sure to make me fail as she made the question which even the people in production dont get the cases. She is also the culprit. I didnt clear the test so they will not talk to me after that. Wht kind of people they are? Yatin and priya dont know anything. I dont know why they are team leaders. I thought priya is good but she says one thing to you and then says some other thing. Earlier she says that raise complaint against HR charajit and next day she said charajit is good. They could have make my exit smooth but what they are doing is nothing. They are pure evil. I didnt get salary for my previous month just because the team lead yatin dont know wht to talk to HR and they both blame each other for NCNS. I am adding all the conversations here. Check everything. I will not leave u all like this. I will fight the legal aid against u all and make sure you get exposed to every platform.

Trust me guys!
They didn't paid me holiday wages and night shift allowances because of the negligence of project manager PARNEET BHASIN and my trainer MOHIT JAINWAL
Both are the cheap not responding call nor replying email
Well i am ready to file complaint against the COGNIZANT pvt ltd as PARNEET BHASIN  and MOHIT JAINWAL both  played with the registration of COMPANY

Moreover COGNIZANT is hiring for the google project and employees are working in intellion edge gurgaon sec 72
Cheapest environment i found there as 2  mins late on break they are  making it issue and shooting mails but when it the turn of trainer he can go on long breaks and keep the trainee on waiting and instructs them not to wait outside  training hall because my subordinates used to ask me and i have to give reason them.

More cheap thing  is you have to book cab weekly if you will miss cab  by mistake they will deduct you amount for that
