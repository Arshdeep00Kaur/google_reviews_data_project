I am mentioning my experience and suggestions in the points below.

My experience:
1) I got a call from HR for a vacancy and we discussed everything including skills set, experience and required package.
2) I have given three rounds of interviews i.e. 2 technical, 1 managerial and spent almost 3 hours of mine.
3) Had to follow up all the times for feedback.
4) Cleared both of the technical rounds and the managerial round was good, The hiring manager provided all the details regarding company and project(s) but at the end he asked for package negotiation which was completely disgusting as the package was discussed from the beginning.
5) I had to again ask for feedback but the HR who was handling my candidature resigned in between and didn't respond then after 3-4 days I got contact of another HR, she also didn't share the feedback then again I had to call the very next day.
6) She told me that you did not receive positive feedback in the managerial round and when I asked for the reason, they didn't share anything.

Suggestion:
1) If the company and project is not having that much budget then HR and HM should not shortlist the respective candidates and should not waste their time.
2) Internal communication and process should be improved in terms of hiring.
3) Technical interviewers and managers should not ask for packages and negotiations.

Think before wasting your time with such companies.
