I‚Äôd like to share my recent Andaman trip experience, booked through MMT with a premium package. We paid ‚Çπ31,000 per person for 3 travelers[excluding flight], including a child. The package promised private travel and cabs, which initially made us excited about a pleasant vacation.

However, as I write this review, I‚Äôve realized the recurring cycle of disappointment with MMT:

Convincing Tactics: They first persuade customers to opt for a private, 4-star package.
Full Payment Requirement: Customers are forced to pay the full amount at least a month before the trip starts.
Subpar Services: Despite the premium promise, we were left with cheap services and accommodations that deviated from the voucher.
Lack of Support: No issues were addressed by the ground support team, tour manager, or MMT representatives, even after multiple escalations and SOS calls during the trip.
Post-trip Compensation: At the journey‚Äôs end, MMT offers a token apology, admitting they didn‚Äôt deliver the promised services.
As a Platinum member, I can attest that this cycle is a common experience for many MMT customers. I strongly recommend considering other travel agencies that offer far superior services at half the price.

MMT seems to lack control over their ground support, as everything is subcontracted‚Äîcar rentals included‚Äîresulting in no single point of accountability.",4 weeks ago,MakeMyTrip,Delhi
