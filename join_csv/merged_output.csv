Hey everyone,

Let me tell you about the time I threw £16,000 down the drain with a company called IndiaNIC, dreaming of a sleek e-commerce site for my business, SIRRI. What a journey it's been - and not the fun kind. Imagine trusting Bhavin Batt and Kiran Jadav, the big names at IndiaNIC, only to end up with a website that's as functional as a chocolate teapot.

Promised a smooth ride and a project wrapped up in 6-12 months, I ended up on a never-ending carousel ride for over two years. And the prize? A website so broken, it's practically a digital wasteland. Every penny of the £13,000 development cost and the extra £3,000 on AWS servers felt like money tossed into a black hole.

I've got a treasure trove of chat histories and recordings that paint the real picture of what went down. It's like a saga of broken promises and shrugged shoulders when I asked for a refund or even just a path forward. They claimed they delivered; I say they delivered a mess.

After a grueling three years and jumping ship to another platform, I finally got what I was promised by someone else. So, what's the moral of the story? Run. Run far away from IndiaNIC and don't look back.

If you're on the hunt for a tech partner, my advice is to do your homework. Don't get dazzled by smooth talkers or fancy portfolios. Demand the real deal - proof of their successes, straight talk from past clients, and clear accountability.

I'm laying it all out here - not just to vent, but to hopefully save some of you from making the same mistake. If you're curious or even a bit skeptical about my story, I'm here with receipts. Chat logs, recordings - you name it. I'm an open book if it means helping someone else avoid this tech partnership pitfall.",9 months ago,Ahmehdabad,IndiaNIC,

Not only did they fail to rectify the issues, but they also refused to provide a refund for their subpar services. It's clear that customer satisfaction and integrity are not priorities for Net Solutions.

Save yourself the headache and avoid Net Solutions at all costs. Their inability to deliver on their promises and their unwillingness to take responsibility for their mistakes make them a poor choice for any project.

Instead of reaching out to me directly to address the issues raised in my review, they decided to post false claims, trying to shift the blame onto us, the customer. This is exactly what they do—avoid taking responsibility and instead place the blame on the client. They do not hold themselves accountable for their own failures.

I’d like to share my recent Andaman trip experience, booked through MMT with a premium package. We paid ₹31,000 per person for 3 travelers[excluding flight], including a child. The package promised private travel and cabs, which initially made us excited about a pleasant vacation.

However, as I write this review, I’ve realized the recurring cycle of disappointment with MMT:

Convincing Tactics: They first persuade customers to opt for a private, 4-star package.
Full Payment Requirement: Customers are forced to pay the full amount at least a month before the trip starts.
Subpar Services: Despite the premium promise, we were left with cheap services and accommodations that deviated from the voucher.
Lack of Support: No issues were addressed by the ground support team, tour manager, or MMT representatives, even after multiple escalations and SOS calls during the trip.
Post-trip Compensation: At the journey’s end, MMT offers a token apology, admitting they didn’t deliver the promised services.
As a Platinum member, I can attest that this cycle is a common experience for many MMT customers. I strongly recommend considering other travel agencies that offer far superior services at half the price.

After clearing the initial interview round, I was encouraged by their team to take an early release from my current job, with the assurance that my selection was nearly certain, pending a few additional rounds. Trusting their confidence in me, I took the early release.

Following two rounds with their senior team, I was scheduled for a client interview, during which I was rejected with the feedback that I lacked experience and knowledge. This was shocking, as the feedback was inconsistent with my previous interviews, and it contradicted the confidence they initially showed in me.

After losing my job and being left in a precarious situation, the HR team scheduled me for another project. Once again, I cleared their internal technical rounds, only to be rejected by the client with similar feedback. This has left me feeling frustrated and misled.

If I truly lacked the skills or experience, it begs the question: why was I pushed to leave my previous job and subjected to multiple rounds, only to be rejected at the final stage? The entire process felt unprofessional and left me jobless due to their mismanagement.

Advice : Please ensure a more transparent and considerate hiring process. Candidates' careers and livelihoods are at stake, and the decisions made by your hiring team have real consequences. If a candidate is not a fit, it should be identified early in the process, and not after they've taken life-altering steps based on your advice.",5 months ago,Hyderabad,ValueLabs,

My experience:
1) I got a call from HR for a vacancy and we discussed everything including skills set, experience and required package.
2) I have given three rounds of interviews i.e. 2 technical, 1 managerial and spent almost 3 hours of mine.
3) Had to follow up all the times for feedback.
4) Cleared both of the technical rounds and the managerial round was good, The hiring manager provided all the details regarding company and project(s) but at the end he asked for package negotiation which was completely disgusting as the package was discussed from the beginning.
5) I had to again ask for feedback but the HR who was handling my candidature resigned in between and didn't respond then after 3-4 days I got contact of another HR, she also didn't share the feedback then again I had to call the very next day.
6) She told me that you did not receive positive feedback in the managerial round and when I asked for the reason, they didn't share anything.

Suggestion:
1) If the company and project is not having that much budget then HR and HM should not shortlist the respective candidates and should not waste their time.
2) Internal communication and process should be improved in terms of hiring.
3) Technical interviewers and managers should not ask for packages and negotiations.

Think before wasting your time with such companies.

If we didn't will to sit post shift, our TL threatened us stating he'll make sure we lose our job. But  you get paid for 9hrs 30 mins only. If you're in need of urgent holiday, you won't get it. Reason - BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. But the fact is many employees bare resigning. Great incentive amount and salary but unachievable targets. I'll share my personal experience regarding salary. On March 2021 I hit a huge incentive amount. On the end of the month of September, I received salary with 4k deduction. On checking with my TL, he said the organisation paid me 4k extra in March incentive by mistake so they deducted it this month. During my FNF they tried to deduct the same amount of 4k again until I got it rectified. Do y'all even keep any updates on what y'all do?? The new HR is a complete idiot. I consulted her regarding issues at this organisation. All i got to hear is robotic responses. All she spoke is about professionalism and my work performance. When i told her that the music played at workplace is unprofessional, she said such songs are completely fine at workplace. Seriously! Naach Meri Raani and Munni Badnaam songs are okay to be played at workplace? Why don't y'all get bartenders and bar dancers at workplace? I informed about me being bullied at workplace, but she said that's how friends be. But I didn't knew those employees but its okay for them to bully me during work? Leave that, the desktop they provide are of ancient period it seems. System issues all the time. In 8 months of WFH i had to replace my system 5 times. I wanted to replace it the 6th time as well but my TL was not willing to help me and forced me to work on the technically broken desktop. I had to travel to and fro from Ola for system replacement as the system were too heavy. But this company didn't care about reimbursing or even arranging pick up & drop.

Even after their medical team approved it yatin said that i cant give leaves. Who is he to decide? All i was asking for day shift for 2 weeks only and their legs shaken. And they talk about my behavior. I am writing this each and every person should read it whole otherwise u will miss the purpose. After that when i start joining all i was asking for some refresher and wht they do is given 1 week training and says there is a certification. The certification which they had taken earlier was a joke.. every person cheated and passed. So in my case they take certification like I am giving upsc exam. I cleared first one technically because pankaj didnt checked properly the exam. And when I raised it, and find some answers are correct he said ok i am allowing u to get into production. Then suddenly after 2 days mayank says give test again. There is no cooperation between them. In second and thirdd test amarjeet make sure to make me fail as she made the question which even the people in production dont get the cases. She is also the culprit. I didnt clear the test so they will not talk to me after that. Wht kind of people they are? Yatin and priya dont know anything. I dont know why they are team leaders. I thought priya is good but she says one thing to you and then says some other thing. Earlier she says that raise complaint against HR charajit and next day she said charajit is good. They could have make my exit smooth but what they are doing is nothing. They are pure evil. I didnt get salary for my previous month just because the team lead yatin dont know wht to talk to HR and they both blame each other for NCNS. I am adding all the conversations here. Check everything. I will not leave u all like this. I will fight the legal aid against u all and make sure you get exposed to every platform. Mayank shrivastava, Gaurav sachdeva, yatin chaabra, priya, amarjeet, pankaj and alll are culprits. I will file a complaint against you all according to labour laws. You alll are pure evils.",5 months ago,Delhi,Tech Mahindra,

I’m sharing my experience to caution potential employees and clients about the unprofessional practices of Tech Mayntra.

Initial Engagement and the Offer:

After graduation, I applied for a job at Tech Mayntra through a posting that advertised a 4-6 LPA salary for freshers. I was excited when I got an interview invite. During the interview, Mr. Laxman Parmar (P2) offered me a mere 12k INR per month, a shocking contrast to what was advertised. When I raised this concern, Mr. Parmar dismissed it, saying that the advertised budget was general and not specific to my role. Eager to start my career, I reluctantly accepted.

Onboarding Issues:

I requested an offer letter before looking for accommodation, but was told to join immediately without formal documentation. I eventually received an offer letter, but it had the wrong designation. When I pointed this out, they promised to correct it during onboarding. This lack of professionalism raised concerns, but I still decided to proceed.

Red Flags on the First Day:

On my first day, I submitted my documents and was shown to a seat without any introduction. There were only two PHP developers and one SEO professional. Out of 12 employees, 8-9 were interns, indicating heavy reliance on inexperienced staff.

Performance Warnings and Company Status:

After just a week, Mr. Parmar gave me a performance warning, claiming I was underperforming, despite having no formal training or guidance. This raised doubts, so I started researching. I discovered that the company hadn’t filed its GST for over a year and was financially unstable. Salaries were often delayed or not credited at all. Realizing the toxic environment, I decided to leave.

Salary and Settlement Issues:

I provided my bank details, but my salary wasn’t credited even after 25 days. They blamed the bank, but later claimed I had said I’d handle account creation myself. I repeatedly asked for my salary, but was told their policy was to credit salaries between the 1st and 10th of every month. Even after leaving, I only received 10,000 INR—less than what I was owed. They falsely claimed I’d taken 5-6 leaves, when I had taken only one. It was clear they were trying to reduce my payout.

Toxic Management and Company Culture:

The management, especially Mr. Subhash Doliya (P1) and Mr. Laxman Parmar (P2), was disorganized and unprofessional. P1 ignored employees’ concerns, and P2 was always busy with clients. There was no HR presence, and communication was mostly through informal channels like WhatsApp, making it hard to document issues or seek resolutions.

Final Recommendation:

This company is a fraud. I advise anyone considering joining to get everything in writing, including a formal offer letter and terms & conditions, before submitting any documents or starting work. Avoid informal communication and insist on emails for documentation. The staff and work culture are unethical, and I hope my review helps others avoid falling into the same trap I did.",3 months ago,,TechMayntra IT Solutions,Ahemdabad

Worst experience working  with gokul, murali. they do not have money to give salary to employee.
Gokul even dont know english language to talk.
They will take support from other people out of company to feel scare u.
No infrastructure.
No job security.
No skills to grow here.
No Management.
If you know tamil  and you are from  kerala and tamilnadu and if you have your own money because they will not provide you salary on time.
While joining time murali will do lots of commitments but once salary date will come he will not come to the office.
Guys if you have your own laptop then you can join this company.
Even they can not provide drinking water to the employee.
Company is running by two partners they will confused you whom to asked about any queries if other its not like he will suggest another thing to you and then they will terminate you.
They didnt provide any documents and salary to previous employee also who left the job already.
When we do upload our own profile on any other job portal with name of immerpact software company they feel your trying to degrade reputation of company.
any way your company is not mnc try to keep in mind and its not any award wining company to degrading companies reputation.
it means immerpact not having any reputation to degrade it.
and even Hari who was my projectmat will tell you all the real thing about murali.
Hari says Murali can not handle the client because he does not know the english and his appearance client will not impress so the communication affects and misunderstanding will creates and they will blame the employee.
I am going to give this company  0 *.
This is your real reputation.",5 years ago,,Immerpact Private Limited,Bengaluru

Later in 2023, my website went down.  GoDaddy who holds my Domains, was somewhat helpful, but could not pinpoint the primary cause.The numerous calls to them were absorbing my busy days causing overwhelming frustrations.

I contacted Joe at Techpertz.  He immediately jumped on board!  Tackling the combination of causes for our downed website.  I am not techy, but understood the problem had to do with an SSL certificate, and Hosting issue from one domain, that was no longer defaulting (forwarding) to our primary website, as we originally set up years ago.  I am sure there were other misc. connections that also had to be reestablished.  For 2.5 days Joe was very dilegent in working out these problems, not giving up until our website was live once again.

Joe even added our new logo to the website that I could not figure out how to upload due to new platform changes.

Thank you Joe for your persistent dedication, even 3 years after our initial contracted work.  It's great having a real person I can call, who has a direct phone no. and personal email to quickly work out a serious downed website problem... rather than an automated helpline; waiting, pushing buttons, being transferred around to different specialty reps., re-explaining the problems again and again each call i had to make.

During Covid19 pandemic, they tried their best to make people to work from office, allowed WFH after government announced lockdown.
2. No employees except higher level managers (not even technical architects) are allowed for work from home.
3. Current time (March 2021) they have come up with a new policy -- if you are coming to office at start of month then you'll have to come to office for whole month, even if you have allowed to work from home and you come to the office say on March 2 then you'll have to continue coming to office for whole March. They are very aggressive on asking people to work from office and not home.
4. If you are on bench (people end up on being on bench due to various reasons like end of the project or new joiner in the organization)
then you have to come to the office and be there for 8 hrs, there are several trainings happen but most of them are conducted online which you can attend from home as well.
5. If you are on bench, then you'll have to buy Udemy courses by spending your own money, company will reimburse it whenever you complete the course.

Why I am emphasizing on WFH related issues?
Answer -- This just another IT company, when most of the people especially bachelors has left their rented Flats and moved to their hometown, this company is asking people to come to the office when the whole industry is okay with providing work from and if you don't come to office then you'll end up getting Zero rupee in salary, it becomes LWP -- (leave without pay).

BMC is not willing to accept their defeat infront of a giant like ServiceNow.
BMC's flagship product ""remedy"" now they call it BMC Helix is old and slow and what not, it lacks besic features but still this company somehow thinks they are the market leaders.

My experience:
1) I got a call from HR for a vacancy and we discussed everything including skills set, experience and required package.
2) I have given three rounds of interviews i.e. 2 technical, 1 managerial and spent almost 3 hours of mine.
3) Had to follow up all the times for feedback.
4) Cleared both of the technical rounds and the managerial round was good, The hiring manager provided all the details regarding company and project(s) but at the end he asked for package negotiation which was completely disgusting as the package was discussed from the beginning.
5) I had to again ask for feedback but the HR who was handling my candidature resigned in between and didn't respond then after 3-4 days I got contact of another HR, she also didn't share the feedback then again I had to call the very next day.
6) She told me that you did not receive positive feedback in the managerial round and when I asked for the reason, they didn't share anything.

Suggestion:
1) If the company and project is not having that much budget then HR and HM should not shortlist the respective candidates and should not waste their time.
2) Internal communication and process should be improved in terms of hiring.
3) Technical interviewers and managers should not ask for packages and negotiations.

Think before wasting your time with such companies.
