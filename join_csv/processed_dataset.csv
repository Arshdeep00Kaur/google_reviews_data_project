I recently participated in Bacancy selection process for the position of Senior Laravel Developer. I took an online test on 4th July 2024, and was subsequently selected for further technical rounds.

Following this, on 11th July 2024, during the third HR round, I was selected for the position of Senior Laravel Developer at Bacancy.

During my discussion with your HR team member, Namrata Bandhaniya, we agreed upon my Expected CTC per annum based on my skills and interview performance. I accepted this offer.

On July 17th, I received an offer letter from Pulkit Phatale with a CTC significantly lower than the previously discussed amount.

On July 18th, I discussed this issue with Pulkit Phatale and Amit, who informed me that there had been a miscommunication with the HR team. They assured me that my CTC would be increased, and a revised offer letter would be sent. However, I did not receive any response that day.

So the management says decision of back to office was taken after careful consideration. So the work from anywhere wasn't taken After careful consideration?

IndiaNIC,1,"Don't Let IndiaNIC Fool You: My Epic Fail of a Tech Partnership

Hey everyone,

Let me tell you about the time I threw £16,000 down the drain with a company called IndiaNIC, dreaming of a sleek e-commerce site for my business, SIRRI. What a journey it's been - and not the fun kind. Imagine trusting Bhavin Batt and Kiran Jadav, the big names at IndiaNIC, only to end up with a website that's as functional as a chocolate teapot.

Promised a smooth ride and a project wrapped up in 6-12 months, I ended up on a never-ending carousel ride for over two years. And the prize? A website so broken, it's practically a digital wasteland. Every penny of the £13,000 development cost and the extra £3,000 on AWS servers felt like money tossed into a black hole.

I've got a treasure trove of chat histories and recordings that paint the real picture of what went down. It's like a saga of broken promises and shrugged shoulders when I asked for a refund or even just a path forward. They claimed they delivered; I say they delivered a mess.

After a grueling three years and jumping ship to another platform, I finally got what I was promised by someone else. So, what's the moral of the story? Run. Run far away from IndiaNIC and don't look back.

If you're on the hunt for a tech partner, my advice is to do your homework. Don't get dazzled by smooth talkers or fancy portfolios. Demand the real deal - proof of their successes, straight talk from past clients, and clear accountability.

I'm laying it all out here - not just to vent, but to hopefully save some of you from making the same mistake. If you're curious or even a bit skeptical about my story, I'm here with receipts. Chat logs, recordings - you name it. I'm an open book if it means helping someone else avoid this tech partnership pitfall.",9 months ago,Ahmehdabad,107644704693125537133,2,0.8855,positive

Net Solutions,1,"My experience with Net Solutions was nothing short of disappointing and frustrating. Despite clearly outlining the scope of work, they consistently failed to deliver on their promises. What's worse is their complete lack of accountability for their mistakes.

Throughout the project, I encountered numerous setbacks and issues, all of which were met with excuses and blame-shifting from Net Solutions. Despite being the paying client, I found myself constantly on the defensive, with Net Solutions refusing to acknowledge their shortcomings.

Not only did they fail to rectify the issues, but they also refused to provide a refund for their subpar services. It's clear that customer satisfaction and integrity are not priorities for Net Solutions.

Save yourself the headache and avoid Net Solutions at all costs. Their inability to deliver on their promises and their unwillingness to take responsibility for their mistakes make them a poor choice for any project.

Instead of reaching out to me directly to address the issues raised in my review, they decided to post false claims, trying to shift the blame onto us, the customer. This is exactly what they do—avoid taking responsibility and instead place the blame on the client. They do not hold themselves accountable for their own failures.

If you have a project that requires experienced, senior-level resources, stay far away from this company. They will mislead you, claiming they can handle it, only to fail in the end, and then accuse you, the customer, of causing the problems.

2. Are you married?
3. How many years have you been married?
4. Do you have any kids?
5. How many kids do you have?
6. What is the age of your kids? ... Blah Blah..

They don't mention anything on offer letter related to Rs 2 Lakhs indemnity-bond and you will get to know about this only on the day of joining which will create a confusion and feeling of betrayal, and if you continue with them, you can't even leave before 1.5 years.
If you raise any concern in those 1.5 years, they will listen to you but won't take any action on it because you have signed a Rs 2 Lakhs bond.

Also, their cafeteria is unhygienic and dirty. You will fall sick by having a meal there. Management doesn't pay any heed to any suggestions.

Or now when I am called him for refund (operator) Mr. Chandan is yelling at me “I will not give you any refund, go and take it from makemytrip” is this a way to talk to your customer, or your company are providing this service?

MakeMyTrip,1,"Avoid Premium Packages with MMT – Disappointing Experience

I’d like to share my recent Andaman trip experience, booked through MMT with a premium package. We paid ₹31,000 per person for 3 travelers[excluding flight], including a child. The package promised private travel and cabs, which initially made us excited about a pleasant vacation.

However, as I write this review, I’ve realized the recurring cycle of disappointment with MMT:

Convincing Tactics: They first persuade customers to opt for a private, 4-star package.
Full Payment Requirement: Customers are forced to pay the full amount at least a month before the trip starts.
Subpar Services: Despite the premium promise, we were left with cheap services and accommodations that deviated from the voucher.
Lack of Support: No issues were addressed by the ground support team, tour manager, or MMT representatives, even after multiple escalations and SOS calls during the trip.
Post-trip Compensation: At the journey’s end, MMT offers a token apology, admitting they didn’t deliver the promised services.
As a Platinum member, I can attest that this cycle is a common experience for many MMT customers. I strongly recommend considering other travel agencies that offer far superior services at half the price.

MMT seems to lack control over their ground support, as everything is subcontracted—car rentals included—resulting in no single point of accountability.",4 weeks ago,Delhi,112824018180145692837,23,0.887,positive

Never going to book any thing from MakeMyTrip. Feeling cheated on my last holiday package to Manali.

MakeMyTrip,1,"Worst Experience from Make My Trip
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I have received regarding my flight booking (PNR No. A99QVJ) from Bangalore to Mumbai dated 6th April 2023 as the flight has been cancelled by the airline itself and not by the customer.

Despite several attempts to resolve this matter through your customer care line, I have yet to receive my refund. Each time I reach out, representatives provide me with various excuses and shifting deadlines, leaving me frustrated and disappointed. It is incredibly disappointing to witness such a lack of accountability and customer care from a reputable company like MakeMyTrip.

To make matters worse, there was no notification about the booking cancellation—if I hadn’t called, I wouldn’t have known.

The interviewer was asking meaning less questions on Supply Chain, Procurement etc. Why would you waste time asking some MBA/Academic questions to  mid senior level candidate ? I understand the basics are important but this was sheer waste of time. Is my experience important or some textbook knowledge?

I did a background on this organization. Most of the employees are from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia etc. They have a use and throw policy  - Once the project is over, you will be terminated. (Unstable career path)  And in the era when organizations are compelling employees to work from office, they are only offering remote, cheap work from home jobs.

HR round happend and HR is mentioning same salary as counter offer is provided because of budget crunches (negotiating even for 10 15K reductions), The shuttle transport is provided until office location's nearest metro, and also the Office Visit should be 5 days instead of hybrid which all these reasons are promised before.

Hiring process is very unprofessional and complicated.
HR told me to attend office for last round of interview but when I reach hyderabad they scheduled HR interview virtually and offered salary(3.6 fixed) less than my previous salary(3.75 fixed). Reason I have 5 months of gap. Literally waste of time and waste of money I spend because of this waste company. I already mentioned my expectation salary around 6 fixed after I asked atleast 5 fixed but they didn't even considered my experience and certifications on my skills.

Leads and heads of this company is worst than anyone as far I see.
Especially HR leads they will call you multiple times and negotiate salary. At any point of time your negotiation salary will be changed even before one day of joining and stop communications as well
I don't wanna mention about their names because I have values but in valuelabs no values with outdated equipments in lab 😂. consider almost every lead and head of department are like this.

ValueLabs,1,"I had a deeply disappointing experience with Valuelabs. After clearing the initial interview round, I was encouraged by their team to take an early release from my current job, with the assurance that my selection was nearly certain, pending a few additional rounds. Trusting their confidence in me, I took the early release.

Following two rounds with their senior team, I was scheduled for a client interview, during which I was rejected with the feedback that I lacked experience and knowledge. This was shocking, as the feedback was inconsistent with my previous interviews, and it contradicted the confidence they initially showed in me.

After losing my job and being left in a precarious situation, the HR team scheduled me for another project. Once again, I cleared their internal technical rounds, only to be rejected by the client with similar feedback. This has left me feeling frustrated and misled.

If I truly lacked the skills or experience, it begs the question: why was I pushed to leave my previous job and subjected to multiple rounds, only to be rejected at the final stage? The entire process felt unprofessional and left me jobless due to their mismanagement.

Advice : Please ensure a more transparent and considerate hiring process. Candidates' careers and livelihoods are at stake, and the decisions made by your hiring team have real consequences. If a candidate is not a fit, it should be identified early in the process, and not after they've taken life-altering steps based on your advice.",5 months ago,Hyderabad,111746744726023295288,2,-0.2357,negative

I visited Tieto on 3 Rd Oct from Mumbai. Boared shivneri or any other ST bus that would drop you to Pune railway station.
Right outside the bus station you will find local city public transportation buses. Get into kharadi Goan bus and from khradi Goan it is 800 meters walk. You can get auto in worst case.

Tietoevry,1,"Worst internal process and ethics of any company I have given interviews so far. I am mentioning my experience and suggestions in the points below.

My experience:
1) I got a call from HR for a vacancy and we discussed everything including skills set, experience and required package.
2) I have given three rounds of interviews i.e. 2 technical, 1 managerial and spent almost 3 hours of mine.
3) Had to follow up all the times for feedback.
4) Cleared both of the technical rounds and the managerial round was good, The hiring manager provided all the details regarding company and project(s) but at the end he asked for package negotiation which was completely disgusting as the package was discussed from the beginning.
5) I had to again ask for feedback but the HR who was handling my candidature resigned in between and didn't respond then after 3-4 days I got contact of another HR, she also didn't share the feedback then again I had to call the very next day.
6) She told me that you did not receive positive feedback in the managerial round and when I asked for the reason, they didn't share anything.

Suggestion:
1) If the company and project is not having that much budget then HR and HM should not shortlist the respective candidates and should not waste their time.
2) Internal communication and process should be improved in terms of hiring.
3) Technical interviewers and managers should not ask for packages and negotiations.

Think before wasting your time with such companies.

They say 9hr 30 mins shift but you need to make sure you login 1hr prior your shift start (even for WFH employees) and sit for 3hrs (additional) post shift most of the day if the whole team didn't achieve the target together. If we didn't will to sit post shift, our TL threatened us stating he'll make sure we lose our job. But  you get paid for 9hrs 30 mins only. If you're in need of urgent holiday, you won't get it. Reason - BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. But the fact is many employees bare resigning. Great incentive amount and salary but unachievable targets. I'll share my personal experience regarding salary. On March 2021 I hit a huge incentive amount. On the end of the month of September, I received salary with 4k deduction. On checking with my TL, he said the organisation paid me 4k extra in March incentive by mistake so they deducted it this month. During my FNF they tried to deduct the same amount of 4k again until I got it rectified. Do y'all even keep any updates on what y'all do?? The new HR is a complete idiot. I consulted her regarding issues at this organisation. All i got to hear is robotic responses. All she spoke is about professionalism and my work performance.

Tech Mahindra,1,"They should be given zero…even zero is valuable they should be given -1000… guys dont ever join tech mahindra. Worst nightmare and anand mahindra doesnt even care beside tweeting in twitter….I am writing this to let you know that I am filing an official complaint against the aasurant management that they are the worst management i have ever seen and they dont have courage to talk to me for anything. Ask anyone if they have talked to me before this decision. Now what they will do is take revenge and stop my relieving letter. If they have courage to talk to an employee i will come to office and see if they can talk how they harrasing the people there in the assurant. They have not given me exception on my behavior. Ask feedback about the management there from anyone working there. These guys should be terminated too. Mayank, gaurav, yatin , priya, amarjeet, pankaj no one came forward to talk to me. They all should be terminated. The manager should tell me about rhe smooth exit but they dont have courage to talk. Only thihg they say is talk to HR.  I will quote everything in social media too so that they get exposed. I cant use abusive words here. I will come to office and if they have courage come and talk to me and see how much empathy u have. They  dont know nothing. So much experience but dont know anything about work and ethics. I want compensation for this month too or I will file a court case agaisnt the management. I have all the proofs. All phone call records and mails and everything. I will drag each one of you. All i was searching was empathy and they have nothing. When I asked for leaves due to liver issue they didnt give it instead wasted my time and was that a big thing i was asking i have given the medical and all and they were like aliens that they dont know how to handle it. Even after their medical team approved it yatin said that i cant give leaves. Who is he to decide? All i was asking for day shift for 2 weeks only and their legs shaken. And they talk about my behavior. I am writing this each and every person should read it whole otherwise u will miss the purpose. After that when i start joining all i was asking for some refresher and wht they do is given 1 week training and says there is a certification. The certification which they had taken earlier was a joke.. every person cheated and passed. So in my case they take certification like I am giving upsc exam. I cleared first one technically because pankaj didnt checked properly the exam. And when I raised it, and find some answers are correct he said ok i am allowing u to get into production. Then suddenly after 2 days mayank says give test again. There is no cooperation between them. In second and thirdd test amarjeet make sure to make me fail as she made the question which even the people in production dont get the cases. She is also the culprit. I didnt clear the test so they will not talk to me after that. Wht kind of people they are? Yatin and priya dont know anything. I dont know why they are team leaders. I thought priya is good but she says one thing to you and then says some other thing. Earlier she says that raise complaint against HR charajit and next day she said charajit is good. They could have make my exit smooth but what they are doing is nothing. They are pure evil. I didnt get salary for my previous month just because the team lead yatin dont know wht to talk to HR and they both blame each other for NCNS. I am adding all the conversations here. Check everything. I will not leave u all like this. I will fight the legal aid against u all and make sure you get exposed to every platform. Mayank shrivastava, Gaurav sachdeva, yatin chaabra, priya, amarjeet, pankaj and alll are culprits. I will file a complaint against you all according to labour laws.

Trust me guys!
They didn't paid me holiday wages and night shift allowances because of the negligence of project manager PARNEET BHASIN and my trainer MOHIT JAINWAL
Both are the cheap not responding call nor replying email
Well i am ready to file complaint against the COGNIZANT pvt ltd as PARNEET BHASIN  and MOHIT JAINWAL both  played with the registration of COMPANY

Moreover COGNIZANT is hiring for the google project and employees are working in intellion edge gurgaon sec 72
Cheapest environment i found there as 2  mins late on break they are  making it issue and shooting mails but when it the turn of trainer he can go on long breaks and keep the trainee on waiting and instructs them not to wait outside  training hall because my subordinates used to ask me and i have to give reason them.

More cheap thing  is you have to book cab weekly if you will miss cab  by mistake they will deduct you amount for that

I believe all the short listed candidates with no complaints agreed to wait until then. In the last week of March 2018 we were again infomred that the issues hasn't fix so we will have to wait till mid April 2018 and we will get the offer letter.
