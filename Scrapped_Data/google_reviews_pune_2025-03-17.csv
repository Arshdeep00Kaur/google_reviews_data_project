During Covid19 pandemic, they tried their best to make people to work from office, allowed WFH after government announced lockdown.
2. No employees except higher level managers (not even technical architects) are allowed for work from home.
3. Current time (March 2021) they have come up with a new policy -- if you are coming to office at start of month then you'll have to come to office for whole month, even if you have allowed to work from home and you come to the office say on March 2 then you'll have to continue coming to office for whole March. They are very aggressive on asking people to work from office and not home.
4. If you are on bench (people end up on being on bench due to various reasons like end of the project or new joiner in the organization)
then you have to come to the office and be there for 8 hrs, there are several trainings happen but most of them are conducted online which you can attend from home as well.
5. If you are on bench, then you'll have to buy Udemy courses by spending your own money, company will reimburse it whenever you complete the course.

Why I am emphasizing on WFH related issues?
Answer -- This just another IT company, when most of the people especially bachelors has left their rented Flats and moved to their hometown, this company is asking people to come to the office when the whole industry is okay with providing work from and if you don't come to office then you'll end up getting Zero rupee in salary, it becomes LWP -- (leave without pay).

I was part of a team who day in and day out interacts with other employees from the org, and there is one thing I can say for sure - other employees from foreign countries also seemed to be always stressed out and that speaks volumes about the kind of toxic culture this organisation displays.
BMC is not willing to accept their defeat infront of a giant like ServiceNow.
BMC's flagship product ""remedy"" now they call it BMC Helix is old and slow and what not, it lacks besic features but still this company somehow thinks they are the market leaders.

My experience:
1) I got a call from HR for a vacancy and we discussed everything including skills set, experience and required package.
2) I have given three rounds of interviews i.e. 2 technical, 1 managerial and spent almost 3 hours of mine.
3) Had to follow up all the times for feedback.
4) Cleared both of the technical rounds and the managerial round was good, The hiring manager provided all the details regarding company and project(s) but at the end he asked for package negotiation which was completely disgusting as the package was discussed from the beginning.
5) I had to again ask for feedback but the HR who was handling my candidature resigned in between and didn't respond then after 3-4 days I got contact of another HR, she also didn't share the feedback then again I had to call the very next day.
6) She told me that you did not receive positive feedback in the managerial round and when I asked for the reason, they didn't share anything.

Suggestion:
1) If the company and project is not having that much budget then HR and HM should not shortlist the respective candidates and should not waste their time.
2) Internal communication and process should be improved in terms of hiring.
3) Technical interviewers and managers should not ask for packages and negotiations.

Think before wasting your time with such companies.
