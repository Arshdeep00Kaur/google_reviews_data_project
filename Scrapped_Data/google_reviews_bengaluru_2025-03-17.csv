I had an utterly disappointing experience with this vendor. The project was delayed significantly, and the infrastructure provided fell far short of our initial discussions. The lack of proper testing only exacerbated the issues. To make matters worse, they failed to pay GST, reflecting a concerning lack of financial responsibility. Additionally, the product was implemented in a manner completely inconsistent with the agreed-upon design. Overall, this vendor's performance has been subpar, and I strongly advise others to consider alternatives. They didnt even design the infra properly, I got a **SECUIRTY BREACH** email from AWS for the infra they designed and hosted the application. Their ceo or team does not take any responsibility for this and they didn't even try respond this when we reached out to them for solving it.

Not only did this vendor disappoint with project delays and subpar work, but the CEO's complete lack of responsiveness after payment is beyond frustrating. Emails have gone unanswered, leaving me with unresolved concerns. This level of unprofessionalism, from the top down, is unacceptable. It's disheartening to see such a disregard for customer communication and satisfaction. Beware before engaging with this company; their after-sales service is severely",a year ago,Bengaluru,DxMinds

Worst experience working  with gokul, murali. they do not have money to give salary to employee.
Gokul even dont know english language to talk.
They will take support from other people out of company to feel scare u.
No infrastructure.
No job security.
No skills to grow here.
No Management.
If you know tamil  and you are from  kerala and tamilnadu and if you have your own money because they will not provide you salary on time.
While joining time murali will do lots of commitments but once salary date will come he will not come to the office.
Guys if you have your own laptop then you can join this company.
Even they can not provide drinking water to the employee.
Company is running by two partners they will confused you whom to asked about any queries if other its not like he will suggest another thing to you and then they will terminate you.
They didnt provide any documents and salary to previous employee also who left the job already.
When we do upload our own profile on any other job portal with name of immerpact software company they feel your trying to degrade reputation of company.
any way your company is not mnc try to keep in mind and its not any award wining company to degrading companies reputation.
it means immerpact not having any reputation to degrade it.
and even Hari who was my projectmat will tell you all the real thing about murali.
Hari says Murali can not handle the client because he does not know the english and his appearance client will not impress so the communication affects and misunderstanding will creates and they will blame the employee.
I am going to give this company  0 *.
